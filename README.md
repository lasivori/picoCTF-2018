### grep 1
###### Challenge
Can you find the flag in file? This would be really obnoxious to look through by hand, see if you can find a faster way. You can also find the file in /problems/grep-1_4_0431431e36a950543a85426d0299343e on the shell server.

###### Writeup
I just had to get to the given folder using the given CTF shell, then used “grep picoctf” to get the flag from the file.
